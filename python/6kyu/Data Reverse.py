# A stream of data is received and needs to be reversed.

# Each segment is 8 bits long, meaning the order of these segments needs to be reversed, for example:

# 11111111  00000000  00001111  10101010
#  (byte1)   (byte2)   (byte3)   (byte4)
# should become:

# 10101010  00001111  00000000  11111111
#  (byte4)   (byte3)   (byte2)   (byte1)
# The total number of bits will always be a multiple of 8.

# The data is given in an array as such:

# [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0]

def data_reverse(data):
    return sum((data[i:i+8] for i in range(len(data)-8, -1, -8)), [])
