# Given three arrays of integers, return the sum of elements that are common in all three arrays.

# For example:

# common([1,2,3],[5,3,2],[7,3,2]) = 5 because 2 & 3 are common in all 3 arrays
# common([1,2,2,3],[5,3,2,2],[7,3,2,2]) = 7 because 2,2 & 3 are common in the 3 arrays

# More examples in the test cases.

# Good luck!
