# The test fixture I use for this kata is pre-populated.

# It will compare your guess to a random number generated using:

# randint(1,100)
# You can pass by relying on luck or skill but try not to rely on luck.

# "The power to define the situation is the ultimate power." - Jerry Rubin

# Good luck!
