# Welcome.

# In this kata you are required to, given a string, replace every letter with its position in the alphabet.

# If anything in the text isn't a letter, ignore it and don't return it.

# "a" = 1, "b" = 2, etc.

# Example
# alphabet_position("The sunset sets at twelve o' clock.")
# Should return "20 8 5 19 21 14 19 5 20 19 5 20 19 1 20 20 23 5 12 22 5 15 3 12 15 3 11" (as a string)

def alphabet_position(text):
    alph = '_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    return ' '.join([str(alph.index(i.lower())) for i in text if i.lower() in alph])
