# Don't give me five!

# In this kata you get the start number and the end number of a region and should return the count of all numbers except numbers with a 5 in it. The start and the end number are both inclusive!

# Examples:

# 1,9 -> 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9 -> Result 8
# 4,17 -> 4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,16,17 -> Result 12

# The result may contain fives. ;-)
# The start number will always be smaller than the end number. Both numbers can be also negative!

# I'm very curious for your solutions and the way you solve it. Maybe someone of you will find an easy pure mathematics solution.
