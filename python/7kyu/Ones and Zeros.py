# Given an array of ones and zeroes, convert the equivalent binary value to an integer.

# Eg: [0, 0, 0, 1] is treated as 0001 which is the binary representation of 1.

# Examples:

# Testing: [0, 0, 0, 1] ==> 1
# Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2
# Testing: [0, 1, 0, 1] ==> 5
# Testing: [1, 0, 0, 1] ==> 9
# Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2
# Testing: [0, 1, 1, 0] ==> 6
# Testing: [1, 1, 1, 1] ==> 15
# Testing: [1, 0, 1, 1] ==> 11

# However, the arrays can have varying lengths, not just limited to 4.
