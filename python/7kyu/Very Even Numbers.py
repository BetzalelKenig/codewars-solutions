# Description:

# #Task:

# Write a function that returns true if the number is a "Very Even" number.

# If a number is a single digit, then it is simply "Very Even" if it itself is even.

# If it has 2 or more digits, it is "Very Even" if the sum of it's digits is "Very Even".

# #Examples:

# input(88) => returns false -> 8 + 8 = 16 -> 1 + 6 = 7 => 7 is odd 

# input(222) => returns true

# input(5) => returns false

# input(841) => returns true -> 8 + 4 + 1 = 13 -> 1 + 3 => 4 is even
# Note: The numbers will always be 0 or positive integers!
